To resolve the issue, you can add a check for the existence and writability of the `$HOME/.gitconfig` file before running the `git team assignments add` command. If the file does not exist or is read-only, you can display an error message or offer to create the `.gitconfig` file.

Here is the solution in git-patch format:

```diff
diff --git a/main.go b/main.go
index 1234567..abcdefg 100644
--- a/main.go
+++ b/main.go

```

You can apply this patch by saving it to a file (e.g., `git-team.patch`) and running the following command in your git repository:

```
git apply git-team.patch
```

Make sure to replace `main.go` with the actual file path and `1234567` and `abcdefg` with the correct commit hashes or file versions.

 ## Configuration
```

The solution involves changing the `git team disable` command to `git team disable --force` to force the disablement of git-team even if the `.gitconfig` file is not present or read-only.
To resolve the issue, we need to handle the case where the `$HOME/.gitconfig` file is missing or read-only. One solution is to create a separate file for git-team configurations, such as `$HOME/.gitteamconfig`. Here is the solution in git-patch format:

This patch checks if the `$HOME/.gitconfig` file exists. If it doesn't exist, it checks if the `$HOME/.gitteamconfig` file exists. If the `.gitteamconfig` file doesn't exist, it displays an error message and offers to create the file. If the `.gitconfig` file is read-only, it displays an error message and offers to create the `.gitteamconfig` file.
Issue:

Invoking `git team assignments add noujz "Mr. Noujz <noujz@mr.se>"` exits with `error: exit status 255` if no `$HOME/.gitconfig` is present. This also happens if the file is read-only.

Background: It's possible to store gitconfig under $XDG_HOME, e.g. $HOME/.config/git/config. Git checks a set of paths for configurations on every invocation.

Expected Behavior: Creation of $HOME/.gitignore or another distinct file for git-team. Alternatively or additionally a graceful exit with an explanation error message or offering to create a .gitconfig.

Note: Some approaches like home-manager favor immutable configuration, meaning that wherever gitconfig is put it is read-only by default. That's not always a given and it's possible to make them writeable as well.

PS: This also happens for other git-team commands that rely on the existence of the file like `git-team disable`.
