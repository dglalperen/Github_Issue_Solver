The issue described in the text is that invoking the command `git team assignments add noujz "Mr. Noujz <noujz@mr.se>"` results in an error with exit status 255 if the `$HOME/.gitconfig` file is not present or if it is read-only. The expected behavior is that either a separate file, such as `$HOME/.gitignore`, is created for git-team or a graceful exit occurs with an error message explaining the issue and offering to create the `.gitconfig` file.

To resolve this issue, you can create a patch file with the following changes:

```
diff --git a/main.go b/main.go
index 1234567..abcdefg 100644
--- a/main.go
+++ b/main.go
@@ -123,6 +123,12 @@ func main() {

+       if _, err := os.Stat(gitconfigPath); os.IsNotExist(err) {
+               log.Fatal("The .gitconfig file does not exist. Please create it.")
+       }

+       }
        // continue with the rest of the program logic
 }
```

You can apply this patch using the `git apply` command.
